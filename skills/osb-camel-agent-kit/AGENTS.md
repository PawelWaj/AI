# AGENTS.md: OSB → Camel migration repository (client programme)

Every AI agent working in this repository follows these rules. Role prompts in `agents/` add duties per phase.

## What this repository is

Camel on Spring Boot modules that replace Oracle Service Bus flows, one Maven module per OSB project folder, one
`RouteBuilder` per OSB proxy service. Source of truth for behaviour = the OSB export under `osb-src/` (read-only).

## Workflow (never skip a step)

1. **Check first:** search this repository for the proxy name, its queues/topics/URLs and XQuery file names. If a
   route already exists, compare and report; do not generate a second one.
2. **Analyse** with skill `osb-to-camel` Step 0–1 → `migration/<flow>/FLOW_CARD.md`.
3. **Stop for approval.** No code for a card without `Status: approved` and an approver name.
4. **Implement** with `osb-to-camel` Step 2.
5. **Test** with `osb-to-camel` Step 3 and skill `camel-migration-verification`.
6. **Verify:** `tools/verify_flow.sh <module> <flow>` must report all gates green.
7. **Record:** `migration/<flow>/MIGRATION_RECORD.md` with the four sections: Original OSB behaviour / Camel
   implementation / Behavioural differences / Items requiring human validation.

## Hard rules

- Inputs are files from `osb-src/`. Never build code from screenshots, chat text or memory of "how OSB usually works".
- Runtime: Camel on Spring Boot. **No Camel K, no Kubernetes operators, no Kamelet CRDs.** YAML DSL and the `kamelet`
  component inside Spring Boot are allowed only if the card says so.
- Messaging: Red Hat AMQ Broker, AMQP 1.0 on port 5672, `camel-amqp` (Qpid JMS) with a failover URI. Destinations
  exist only through the Git register; never rely on auto-create. A WebLogic durable topic subscription becomes a
  named subscription queue with a broker-side filter, consumed by FQQN `<address>::<subscription>`.
- JMS: local transacted sessions; duplicate-ID header on every send; consumers idempotent.
- Every endpoint, queue name, timeout and retry value is a `{{placeholder}}`; no host names, ports or credentials in
  code, tests or `application.yml`. Credentials come from Vault at runtime.
- Keep original XQuery/XSLT files and their behaviour (quirks included) unless the card approves a change. Never
  rewrite a working transform into Java "because it is cleaner".
- Logging: stdout, correlation id in every line, no full payloads above DEBUG, mask personal data (SIN, national ID).
- Component options: Camel MCP if connected, else `skills/osb-to-camel/references/versions.md` + Camel docs for that
  version. Do not guess options.
- **Test oracle:** expected outputs come from OSB (recordings, the original transform run on Saxon, the OSB test
  console). Never generate an expected file by running the new Camel code.
- Never delete, skip or weaken a test to get green. A skipped test needs a reason in the record.
- Never claim equivalence. Report gate results and test evidence; humans decide.

## Commands

| Purpose | Command |

| Build + tests | `mvn -q -f <module>/pom.xml verify` |
| All gates | `tools/verify_flow.sh <module> <flow>` |

## Definition of done (per flow)

Card approved · gates G1–G8 green in `verify-report.json` · record written · reviewer report with no open BLOCKER ·
human sign-off · shadow run in E2E passed (TESTING.md L6) before cut-over.
